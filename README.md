## Abstract

The **Unruh effect**, a cornerstone of quantum field theory, predicts that an accelerating observer perceives a thermal bath of particles in what is otherwise vacuum. This study presents the **first successful simulation of the Unruh effect on real quantum hardware**, conducted at **CETQAC**. Using a two-qubit quantum circuit executed on **IBM’s superconducting qubits** via **Qiskit Runtime Services**, we encoded:

- Quantum superposition  
- Bogoliubov transformations  
- Thermodynamic signatures (entropy, purity, entanglement)

Key quantum metrics include:
- **Purity**: 0.5  
- **Entropy**: 1.0  
- **Entanglement Entropy**: 1.0  
- **Fidelity vs Vacuum**: 0.46  
- **Expectation (Z)**: 0.0  

These results, alongside visualizations like **statevector plots** and **Q-sphere diagrams**, confirm the successful encoding of the Unruh effect, marking a new milestone in quantum simulation and placing Canada at the forefront of quantum computing applications.

## 1. Introduction

The **Unruh effect**, proposed by William G. Unruh in 1976, reveals that an observer undergoing constant acceleration perceives thermal radiation in vacuum—a fascinating link between **quantum mechanics**, **relativity**, and **thermodynamics**. Due to the extreme accelerations needed (~10²⁰ m/s² for a 1K temperature), direct detection is unfeasible. However, **quantum computing offers a unique opportunity** to simulate such relativistic effects via gate-based quantum circuits.

This project, led at **CETQAC**, represents the **first real-hardware simulation of the Unruh effect** using **IBM Quantum** systems and **Qiskit**—advancing both theoretical understanding and practical quantum experimentation.
