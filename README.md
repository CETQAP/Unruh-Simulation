# Unruh-Simulation
This repository presents the first successful simulation of the Unruh effect on real quantum hardware, conducted at the Centre of Excellence for Technology, Quantum, and AI Canada (CETQAC). The Unruh effect, a key prediction of quantum field theory, states that an accelerating observer experiences a thermal bath in a vacuum.
